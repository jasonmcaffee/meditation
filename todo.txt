- modal select box

- track timer configuration
a track is comprised of N sounds timers, each repeating (or once) every N minutes/seconds
-- sound configuration
interval or timeout that plays a sound.  needs to take into consideration pause/reset of stopwatch, or perhaps higher level thing does that, but it needs to be able to pause.

- set alarm time to 0 after the alarm has gone off
- sound settings modal
- show modal event?

- android
-- file system write ENOENT
-- fix font
-- did a hack for sound file naming to use _ instead of -, but we need to change all sound files to be one naming with _


- export data
- calendar integration? https://github.com/wmcmahan/react-native-calendar-events
- sound alarm when app is in background.  not sure this is useful.

Later
============================
SQLite didn't work out of the box.  Revisit later.  File system will work for the next couple of years.

- do not disturb mode is not possible

- maybe its best if the guided meditations are by me?  might be weird to listen to though...
otherwise need licensing permission? or embed youtube & soundslice?
