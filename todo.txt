- save preferences/current selections to disk and reload when app loads

- modal select box for tracks
-- group tracks together
-- group sounds by type.  e.g. metal bowl strike, metal bowl ring, chimes.  Perhaps use a tag for grouping?  or just use sub objects.

- fix play/pause issue with scheduled sounds.  Soft Stream with Strike Every Minute chimes go off unexpectedly after multiple play pause presses.


- set alarm time to 0 after the alarm has gone off
- sound settings modal


- android
-- file system write ENOENT
-- fix font
-- did a hack for sound file naming to use _ instead of -, but we need to change all sound files to be one naming with _


- export data
- calendar integration? https://github.com/wmcmahan/react-native-calendar-events
- sound alarm when app is in background.  not sure this is useful.

Later
============================
SQLite didn't work out of the box.  Revisit later.  File system will work for the next couple of years.

- do not disturb mode is not possible

- maybe its best if the guided meditations are by me?  might be weird to listen to though...
otherwise need licensing permission? or embed youtube & soundslice?
